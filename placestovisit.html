    <h2>Alappuzha</h2>
    <p>
        Nicknamed the "sunshine state" for its year-round warm weather, Goa is 
        home to India's top beaches, fringed by palms and stretching for miles
        along the Arabian Sea. Each beach has its own vibe, from backpacker hangouts
        to wellness-focused yoga retreats.
        If you're looking for an upbeat scene, beaches like Anjuna, Baga, and Calangute offer
        water sports like surfing and parasailing, as well as live music on the sands after sunset.
        You can unwind or keep the party going at beach shacks, where bars serve ice-cold beer and
        restaurants dish up seafood like prawn tempura and tuna tartare.

    <h2>Silent Valley</h2>
    <p>
        Silent Valley National Park is a beautiful representation of the last remaining rain forest of Kerala. Historically it’s a paradigm of people’s movement to protect the forest. Silent Valley was declared as National Park in 1984 and formally inaugurated in the year 1985. Initially there was only 89.52 sq.km. area under the Division which forms the core zone of the National Park. In 2007, an area of 148 sq.km. was added to this Division as buffer zone. In 1914, Silent Valley forests were declared as Reserved Forest. Till 1921, Silent Valley was part of South Malabar Forest Division with headquarters at Nilambur. During 1921, it came under control of Palakkad Forest Division and managed so until 1988.It is located in the rich biodiversity of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Karimpuzha Wildlife Sanctuary, New Amarambalam Reserved Forest, and Nedumkayam Rainforest in Nilambur Taluk of Malappuram district, Attappadi Reserved Forest in Mannarkkad Taluk of Palakkad district, and Mukurthi National Park of Nilgiris district, are located around Silent Valley National Park. Mukurthi peak, the fifth-highest peak in South India, and Anginda peak are also located in its vicinity. Bhavani River, a tributary of Kaveri River, and Kunthipuzha River, a tributary of Bharathappuzha river, originate in the vicinity of Silent Valley. The Kadalundi River has also its origin in Silent Valley.

    <h2>Bekal Fort</h2>
    <p>
        There is also another belief that it was originally built by Kolathiri Rajas and later captured by Sivappa Naik. The fort was occupied by Hyder Ali of Mysore in 1763 A.D and then the Huzur of Canara during Tipu Sultan's reign and later by the British. During the British rule, the erstwhile Bekal taluk was part of South Canara district and encompassed the present Kasaragod and Hosdurg taluks.
        The fort with its zigzag entrance, strategically designed openings on the outer walls for defense and trenches around, has no palaces inside and was probably build just for Defence purposes. The sea bastion, underground tunnels and the observation tower in the fort are impressive. The Bekal Fort has been a source of attraction for historians, tourists and nature - lovers for centuries since it embodies memories of a glorious past. Just outside the fort there is a mosque built by Tippu Sultan of Mysore. At the entrance is the Anjaneya temple, dedicated to Sree Hanuman. Said to be as old as the fort itself, the shrine was recently renovated and attracts hundreds of devotees from far and near.
